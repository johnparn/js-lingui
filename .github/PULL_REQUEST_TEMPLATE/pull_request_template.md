# Important! 

**Read first but remove this section before sumbitting your PR**

This project is undergoing massive refactoring in `next` branch
which should be released very soon. Due to lack of resources
all PRs must be made against `next` branch. If you want to backport
your feature to `master` as well, you're welcome to do it.

**All PRs to `master` without accompanying PR to `next` will be sadly ignored**
